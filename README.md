# Reduction-of-Information

In order to reduce the information, we can apply different methods. PCA, Ridge and Lasson regressions are the most commonly used methods for this purpose. With a reduction of information it is possible to focus on the main axes. The most important variables will be the ones that have the most weight in the model.
